  "text": "Dry Run Analysis: Code Execution Analysis. Detailed step-by-step execution of the code. Step 1: Let's begin by initializing our variables. We start with index i set to zero and total sum set to zero.. Step 2: Now we're at index 0, processing the value 10. We add this to our running total.. Step 3: Now we're at index 1, processing the value 20. We add this to our running total.. Step 4: Now we're at index 2, processing the value 30. We add this to our running total.. Step 5: Now we're at index 3, processing the value 40. We add this to our running total.. Step 6: Now we're at index 4, processing the value 50. We add this to our running total.. Step 7: We have completed processing all elements. The final sum is calculated and ready to be returned.. Final output: 150. Time complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(1).",
